# Vorboss Test

## Technologies
I chose React for frontend due to my proficieny in it.
Backend is Node. 
As a database I've picked MongoDB with Mongoose for ease of use.

## Design
I kept it simple with 2 pages. One for listing customers and another for adding.
I didn't spend too much time on styling. Just added some basic CSS.

## How to run
I've added a docker compose file which uses docker files for BE / FE and a mongo image for DB.
Doing `docker-compose up` should be sufficient to run the application, provided docker is running.
